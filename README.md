# Functional Programming Exercises

Welcome to the repository for the course *Functional Programming and Verification* at TUM during the Summer Semester of 2023.

Here, you will find a collection of exercises designed to help you practice and master functional programming concepts. The primary language used for these exercises is [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org), a powerful functional programming language.

Please note that all codes in this repository are intended to run on Linux systems.

Feel free to explore the exercises, work on them, and deepen your understanding of functional programming. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.
