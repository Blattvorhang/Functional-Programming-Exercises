# Functional Programming Exercises
This repository contains the exercises for the course *Functional Programming and Verification* at TUM during the Summer Semester of 2023.

The course primarily utilizes [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org) as the functional programming language of choice. Codes run in Linux.

## Achievements
In the [final contest programming excercise](./Week_10/Homework_02_and_Contest_CrazyCamelCompetition/), I used to be the first place, and finally won the third place.  
The score refers to the number of rounds I won.

I hope you can learn something through this repository.
